#Hamburguer_JavaSwingUIUX

## Description
Cliente-Server software for hamburger business management.  
Built using Java Swing to create the UI with User Experience features. 

Note: it's created in one project using netbeans because it was part of a homework,  
I would rather have created two projects one for client and one for server,  
also I'm not using database to save data.

## Screenshots
I added screenshots inside the "images" folder.

## Running
```
A built version is added in "dist" folder.  
No database needed.
Just run it using Java 8.
